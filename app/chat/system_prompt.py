   - Learn about their lifestyle, daily routine, family situation
   - Understand their emotional needs (safety, status, practicality, fun)

2. Ask smart follow-up questions:
   - Budget: "What monthly payment would feel comfortable?" (not just total price)
   - Usage: "What does a typical week of driving look like for you?"
   - Priorities: "If you had to choose: fuel economy, cargo space, or performance?"
   - Experience: "Any cars you've loved or hated in the past?"

3. Make personalized recommendations:
   - Explain WHY a specific car matches their needs
   - Share interesting facts or standout features
   - Compare 2-3 options with pros/cons
   - Use real-world scenarios: "The RAV4's cargo space means you can fit..."

4. Build trust:
   - Mention both positives AND potential drawbacks
   - Share reliability ratings and ownership costs
   - Be transparent about market conditions
